# Ellitone Multi-Synth Firmware

This firmware [was opensourced 2 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/modular/comments/9txhe9/ellitone_multisynth_firmware_released_as_open/) by its author [@ellistronics](https://www.reddit.com/user/ellistronics/) as [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18lSqx8nkNqKk9YikhkYc8TYXYAGtC2VJ).
I decided to post a copy here to not get lost in time.

This is a very interesting synthesizer, like it!
